# CLI-Amazon

Welcome to CLI-Amazon, the Amazon-like storefront in command line (only customer view available right now)

The interface shows items for sale on Bamazon, and there will be several following questions regarding what you want to purchase.

After you've correctly entered a product ID and a quantity, you will be asked some following questions regarding the transaction.

You can choose whether to buy more afterwards.
